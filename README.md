Check_email
===========

Class to check the existence of an email address with SMTP

Usage is simple, check the test.php

The function check_email() will simulate sending an email using SMTP, but will not actually send one.

It's usage is to validate existence to avoid mistyping and spammers, who are known for using non existing email addresses.

I have not tested it extensively yet, so reporting issues and PR's are welcome.
